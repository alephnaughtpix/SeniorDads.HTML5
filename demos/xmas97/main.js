    this.asdf = "You damn ripper!!! Well, It's your problem because in attempting to rip this great demo you have released the SENIOR SAD RIPPERS VIRUS on your system! It's a virus which infects your keyboard chip and waits until the year 2000 and then DELETES YOUR HARD DRIVE!!!! This also recognises Richard Karsmakkers virus killer and DELETES THAT AS WELL! It also infects email and spreads itself to your friends!!! And it adds the string 'I am a twat and I tried to mess with the coding genii that are the SENIOR DADS niavely thinking I could somehow equal their unequalable coding feats!' to every email you send!!!  It can also jump computer species like BSE and INFECT YOUR PC AS WELL!!! The only way to reverse this stealth polymorphic virus from the keyboard ram is to type the string 'I am really sorry SENIOR DADS for being so base as to think I could rip your brilliant work off for my own nefarious purposes. I am a very low piece of human garbage indeed!' forty two times! ";
